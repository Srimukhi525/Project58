          <p> My hobby is to speedcube. Speedcubing is when you are speedsolving all kinds of Rubik's cubes. I can currently solve the 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 without any help. This keeps me busy all the time. My efficiency skills have gone up. THis is a very good mental activity if you want a mental challenge.
